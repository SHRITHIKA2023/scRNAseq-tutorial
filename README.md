# Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) Tutorial

## üìå Introduction
Single-cell RNA sequencing (**scRNA-seq**) is a powerful tool that allows us to study gene expression at the individual cell level. 
Unlike bulk RNA-seq, which provides an average measurement across all cells, scRNA-seq helps identify heterogeneity within a sample and enables detailed biological insights.

## ‚ùì Why Use scRNA-seq?
- **Identifies rare cell types within complex tissues
- **Reveals cellular heterogeneity in disease studies
- **Tracks cellular differentiation across time
- **Improves precision medicine approaches** 

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Before running the analysis, install the required R packages:

```r

## üìÇ How to Download scRNA-seq Data for Practice

If you're new to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and want real-world data for analysis, follow these steps to download **TCGA** datasets:

### **Step-by-Step Guide**
**Visit TCGA Data Portal.
**Select Brain Cancer Data.  
**Navigate to Repository.  
**Filter for scRNA-seq Data.  
**Refine by File Format** ‚Äì In filters, select HDF5 format for structured data.  
**Choose a Dataset** ‚Äì You‚Äôll find **17 files available . Select any one to begin your scRNA-seq analysis.

After downloading, you can load the data into Seurat for preprocessing and clustering.

# Install necessary packages
install.packages(c("Seurat", "umap", "ggplot2"))
BiocManager::install("BiocFileCache")
