# Single-Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) Tutorial

## üìå Introduction
Single-cell RNA sequencing (**scRNA-seq**) is a powerful tool that allows us to study gene expression at the individual cell level. 
Unlike bulk RNA-seq, which provides an average measurement across all cells, scRNA-seq helps identify heterogeneity within a sample and enables detailed biological insights.

## ‚ùì Why Use scRNA-seq?
- **Identifies rare cell types within complex tissues
- **Reveals cellular heterogeneity in disease studies
- **Tracks cellular differentiation across time
- **Improves precision medicine approaches** 

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Before running the analysis, install the required R packages:

```r
# Install necessary packages
install.packages(c("Seurat", "umap", "ggplot2"))
BiocManager::install("BiocFileCache")
